# tensorflowjs-digitrecognizer
A simple digit recognizer made with an HTML 5 canvas and tensorflowjs 

# How to run

If you are not running it on a server/loclhost open index.html in firefox. Other browsers aren't supported with the tensorflow js api because security reasons.

If you are running it on a host go crazy and open it on any browser

<b>PS : I recommend running it on node / wamp or something that'll put it on a localhost / host</b>
